# Oh To Be A Scholar! A Senior Project by Miracle Awonuga ðŸŽ“
College has historically been an essential part of our society. Most parents dream of their child attending the best schools in the country, and they will go to any length to achieve this goal. This journey starts with the question: where do I send my child to school? Over the years, there have been many debates on which type of school to send a child to that guarantees their ability to be a college-bound scholar. However, what if this conversation was unnecessary? This interactive research exhibit will attempt to answer this question by exploring the importance of ACT scores, chronic absenteeism, and access to Early Post Secondary Opportunities (ESPOs) and using a predictive model to compare the differences between expected and actual post-secondary enrollment with these factors in mind.
